Here’s a polished **README.md** (in English) you can place in the root of your GitHub portfolio.
It’s already tailored for a Data Scientist applying to roles like the CI\&T position and showcasing projects for a client like MCF London.

# AI Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **AI & Data Science Portfolio**!  
This repository showcases practical projects I’ve built to demonstrate technical expertise and problem-solving skills in real-world scenarios.

These projects were designed to reflect the requirements of enterprise-level clients (such as financial or healthcare leaders) looking to leverage **Machine Learning, NLP, Generative AI, and Knowledge Graphs** to solve non-trivial business problems.

---

## 📌 Main Focus Areas

✅ **Data Exploration & Big Data Insights**  
✅ **Machine Learning Pipelines (structured & unstructured data)**  
✅ **Natural Language Processing (NLP/NLU)**  
✅ **Generative AI & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
✅ **A/B Testing and Business Metrics Evaluation**  
✅ **Knowledge Graph Construction and Integration**
